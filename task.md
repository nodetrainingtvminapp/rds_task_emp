# 🎉 Event Management Platform Project: Task Breakdown & Plan 📝

This is a practical, real-world project that will help you get hands-on experience with backend development using ⚙️ Express.js and 🐘 PostgreSQL, along with file handling 📁, API development 🌐, and more. Here is a detailed breakdown of the tasks and how you can plan your work.

## Overview 🗒️

The "Event Management Platform" is a web application where users can create, manage, and register for events 🎟️. We have two roles involved: **Attendees** and **Organizers/Admins**:

- **👥 Attendee**: Can browse events, register, and manage their event participation.
- **👨‍💼 Organizer/Admin**: Can create, update, and manage events, including adding cover images. They also oversee all events and manage user activities.

### Project Flow 🔄

1. **User Registration & Login 🔑**: Users (Attendees and Organizers/Admins) need to register and log in to access the platform. 🔒 JWT-based authentication is used for secure login.
2. **Event Creation & Management 🗓️**: Organizers/Admins create events, including adding details like titles, descriptions, dates, locations, and cover images.
3. **Event Browsing 🔍**: Attendees browse the list of available events. Events can be filtered based on categories, dates, or keywords.
4. **Event Registration 📝**: Attendees register for events, and a 📄 PDF ticket is generated for them. Capacity is validated to ensure it does not exceed the limit.
5. **Interactive Features 💬**: Attendees can post comments or questions about events, and Organizers/Admins can respond.
6. **File Handling 📁**: Cover images for events are uploaded, and PDF tickets are generated upon successful registration.
7. **API Integration 🌐**: REST APIs are developed to allow interaction with frontend frameworks like ⚛️ React, ⚡ Angular, or 🟢 Vue.js.
8. **Deployment ☁️**: The application is deployed on a cloud platform, ensuring it is accessible to users.

This project involves developing user authentication, event management, file uploads, API integration, and backend services using raw SQL queries initially, which will later be transitioned to Sequelize ORM. The goal is to complete this project within **two weeks** 🗓️.

## Project Tasks 📝

### 1. User Authentication (Days 1-2) 🔑

- **Login & Registration**:
  - Implement JWT-based authentication using raw SQL queries.
  - Develop roles: **Attendee** and **Organizer/Admin**.
  - Attendees can register and participate in events.
  - Organizer/Admin can create and manage events.

### 2. Event Management (Days 3-5) 🗓️

- **Create, Update, Delete Events**:
  - Organizer/Admin can create events, including setting titles, descriptions, dates, and locations using raw SQL queries.
  - Cover images should be added during event creation (file handling 📸).
- **Registration**:
  - Attendees can register for events. Implement maximum capacity validation for each event.

### 3. File Handling (Day 6) 📁

- **Cover Images**: Enable Organizer/Admin to upload event cover images.
- **PDF Ticket Generation**:
  - When an attendee registers, generate a downloadable 📄 PDF ticket that includes details like event name and QR code.

### 4. Interactive Features (Day 7-8) 💬

- **Comments & Questions**:
  - Implement a feature allowing attendees to post questions/comments on event pages using raw SQL queries.
  - Allow Organizer/Admin to respond to these queries.
- **Search Functionality 🔍**:
  - Enable users to search and filter events by category, date, or keyword.

### 5. API Development & Integration (Days 9-10) 🌐

- Develop and test REST APIs for event browsing, registration, comments, etc. using raw SQL queries.
- Allow integration with frontend frameworks so that attendees can use your API from React/Angular apps.

### 6. ORM Transition & Refactoring (Day 11) 🔄

- Refactor existing raw SQL queries to use Sequelize ORM for easier database management and scalability.

### 7. Deployment (Day 12) ☁️

- Deploy the application on a cloud platform.
- Use **environment variables** to distinguish between development and production environments.

## Suggested Workflow & Approach 🛠️

- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: Start by building the core features using raw SQL queries, and gradually add more functionality like event management and file uploads. Later, transition to Sequelize ORM.
- **Pair Programming 👥**: Work in pairs or small groups for complex features like ticket generation and PDF downloads. This will make problem-solving easier and improve your teamwork skills.
- **Frontend Integration ⚛️**: Once the backend APIs are stable, integrate them with a simple front-end (using React, Angular, or Vue). This will help you understand how APIs work in real-world scenarios.

## Key Learning Points 📚

1. **Backend Development**: Build robust backend APIs using ⚙️ Express.js.
2. **Authentication 🔒**: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
3. **Database Management 🗄️**: Start with raw SQL queries and transition to using PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM to model complex relationships.
4. **File Handling 📁**: Learn how to handle file uploads and generate dynamic PDF tickets.
5. **Deployment ☁️**: Gain experience deploying your application to a cloud service.

## Final Note ✨

This project will be a great opportunity to understand backend development holistically, from user management to API creation, and even deployment. Take it step-by-step, collaborate with each other, and have fun exploring different parts of this platform.
